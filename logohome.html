<div class="logo1">This logo was made for my friend Jake Caggino that needed a logo for an app that he was working on called "Ubored?". The colors were chosen by Jake himself and then he left the rest up to me. All drawings were done by me in Adobe Illustrator. To see the project click <a href="Ubored.pdf">here.</a></div>
