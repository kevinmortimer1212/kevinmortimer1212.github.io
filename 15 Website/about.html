	<p>Jake is an up and coming American Euntrepenuer from Reading, Massachuessetes. His life goal was always to help people and is one of the most out going people you will ever meet. With his infectious personality Jake believes that he knows what people are looking for in life. One thing that Jake realized a long time ago was that people around him have been wasting their free time by just sitting around. Jake has always suffered from ADHD and that means that he rarely is ever sitting still doing nothing, which he now realized was a good thing.</p>

	<p>In his mission to help people get off the phone and get up off the couch Jake wanted to think of a way to do that. Over time he realized that people could not go a long period of time without looking for their phones and that is how the idea for the Ubored? Company started. He knew that he had to use their phones against them to make them get up and be active with him.</p>

	<p>Jake also calls himself a "townie" but not what are you thinking he is not from southie he is talking about having spirt in his home town. That is a big part of his life because his parents are local bussiness owners and Jake grew up working there. This is the other part of the Ubored? Company in the thought that the app should also promote local bussinesses.</p>
