	<p class="kevp">I am Kevin Mortimer, and I am a 21 year old graphic designer. I have done art all of my life, and in highschool really stepped up my game and took as many art classes as I could. I then went to Wentworth Institute of Technology where I was going to study Industrial Design. During my freshman year I realized that I did not like the Idustrial Design aspect of the classes, but more of the parts of the projects that we had to do online. So I decided to switch to middlesex and try out Graphic Design classes, and finish some of the required classes by all schools. I then decided to get my Graphic Design certificate at the SMFA, which I am happy to say I have completed. I am currently thinking of going back and finishing a 4 year degree on the weekends, and while doing that looking to get some real world experince. </p>
