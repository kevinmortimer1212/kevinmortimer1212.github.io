	<p>The Ubored? Company is a place that is trying to help the entire world not be bored ever again. The way the company is going to try to accomplish this large task is by creating an application for your smart phone. There has always been talk about how new technology, espesially the smartphone is making people less social. We are trying to turn that notion on its head by making you use your smartphone to actually become more social weither its meeting new people or finding something new to do with old friends.</p>

	<p>The Ubored? application is a one stop application that will help you find local establishmenets that you may not have known were in your neighbor hood. Due to the platform that the application will be running on most people will think that the application is only for the younger age bracket, that is not true. The Ubored? application will have a feature that you can serach for things by the age bracket you are in. Our main features will be described more in deatail in the <a href="app.html">"The App"</a>section of the website.</p>

	<p>Please help support the misson of the Ubored? company by talking to the founder of the company Jake Caggiano. He was the one the orignally was sitting there and thinking "I'm Bored" to come up with the idea of an appliction that would get you off the couch and make you no longer bored and leave you sitting in your house all day. This application will not only help people get out of the house and do more but form the local business side of the apllication there is a lot of room for local businesses to submit themselves to the appication and help local buisnesses make a come back and start thriving again. </p>
